## Overview

The **Smart Safety Web Application** is a tool for managing DX safety permits with features such as:
- Replacing paper-based forms with digital web applications.
- Real-time tracking of work permits.
- Utilizing AI cameras to monitor worker safety and generate reports.

## Features

- **DX Safety Form**: Input safety data digitally.
- **Work Permit Management**: Approve and auto-generate permits with real-time tracking.
- **AI-Powered Monitoring**: Detect dangerous worker actions using AI cameras.
- **Smart AI Reporting**: Generate real-time safety behavior reports.

## Scope of Development

### Phase 1
- Build request and approval modules.
- Implement rules and permissions for the approval process.
- Simulate AI camera monitoring for real-time safety tracking.
